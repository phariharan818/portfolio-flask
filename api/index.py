The implications of this is that certain groups of people might find themselves more certain in their ability to succeed in this industry and some may not based on their skin color. However, the analysis we created is strictly looking at Vogue USA data, so it must be viewed from this viewpoint because the reality is that not everyone has the chance to become a Vogue model. People looking at our analysis have to keep this in mind in order to make decisions based on the results.\n\n These graphs show that there is a range of lightness values for models that had 1-3 covers, but after that the value is mostly higher. It's evident that there is a preference for a certain skin tone as indicated by the lightness values. The number doesn’t go down past 0.6 once a model hits five covers, which implies that the models that have the most covers have lighter skin. There is a point that has a very low lightness value but has been on the Vogue cover for 4 times, but it looks more like an outlier than an honest attempt for Vogue to include more darker skin models since there is still an accumulation of points with higher lightness value across the number of covers in Figure 2. Not only that, when considering the models that have 5 or more Vogue covers, the lightness value lies just in between 0.6 and 0.7, indicating that there is preference for that specific lightness value.",

What is the preference for the skin color of the Vogue magazine models over time? When did this change begin happening?** \n\n &ensp;&ensp;-Our graph depicts more lighter-colored models being used overall, especially in the years 2004 and 2013.\n\n**Question 3: Is the modeling industry diverse, or do they just seem that way?**\n\n &ensp;&ensp;-Many organizations have issues with using diversity as a tool for their own success. If the modeling industry is the same way, that could give us a lot of insight into what their true motivations are and whether it is ethical or not. By knowing whether diversity is used instrumentally, we can see how people of color are impacted.",
